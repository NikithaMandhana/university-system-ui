The problem addressed in this study is sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. Given a set of Amazon product review texts as inputs, the goal is to classify each review as either positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the text. The output of the model is a binary label for each review indicating the predicted sentiment polarity. 

In this project, we have performed sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using three different models: BERT-CNN, GPTLSTM, and Co-LSTM. These models were developed and trained
on the input data to classify the reviews. In each of these models, we initially tokenize the inputs, and feed them to a neural network architecture for classification.
